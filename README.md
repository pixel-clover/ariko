An AI assistant for Unity

</div>

---

Ariko is an open-source Unity plugin that integrates AI chat features directly into your workflow.
It acts as a development partner, helping you write code, understand complex concepts, and debug issues without leaving the Unity Editor.

You can think of it as a copilot for your Unity project.

### Core Features (Roadmap)

* **Interactive Chat:** A primary chat window where you can ask questions in natural language.
* **Context Awareness:** The assistant will know which asset, GameObject, or script you have selected to provide relevant help.
* **Code Generation:** Generate C# scripts, methods, or snippets based on your prompts.
* **Project Analysis:** Answer questions about your existing codebase.
* **Unity API Helper:** Explain how to use Unity components and functions with relevant examples.
