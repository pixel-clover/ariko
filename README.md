This repository contains a generic project template for Unity game engine.
It is designed to speed up the process of setting up
new Unity projects and to maintain a consistent structure across different projects.
I'm sharing this template in the hope that it will be useful to others.

See [Assets/README.md](Assets/README.md) for more details about the structure of the `Assets` directory.

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository (or download the ZIP file)**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/habedi/template-unity-project.git
    ```

2. **Open the project in Unity**:
    - Open Unity Hub.
    - Click on `Add` and select the cloned repository folder.

3. **Customize the template**:
    - Modify the files and directories in the `Assets` folder to suit your project needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might need to configure a few settings in Unity before starting development.
> For example, you might want to change the default layout, enable or disable certain packages, configure the rendering
> pipeline, etc.
> By default, the project uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
